[![License: Unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-blue.svg)](http://unlicense.org/)

## Description

This is an application that allows a user to create, edit, and remove notes. It has a back-end server where all of their notes are stored in a database. This ensures that the notes are kept unless the user explicitly requests that they be erased.
